<p>Last year, I ran a <em>D&amp;D</em> campaign set in and around a modern-day <span class="caps">US</span> high school. This post is just a dump of all my thoughts and some of the resources I made for the campaign. It’s intended to be browsed casually, not read from beginning to&nbsp;end.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone out there will find it interesting and/or useful. I hope&nbsp;so!</p>

<h2><a id="Structure"></a>Structure</h2>
<p>We had 16 sessions in total, over the six months from the 26th of June to the 18th of December. I had been inspired to return to <em>D&amp;D</em> after watching CollegeHumor’s really excellent <a href="https://www.dropout.tv/dimension-20"><em>Dimension 20</em></a>, and I thought that trying something with a similar structure could be&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>One thing that I found really fascinating about <em>Dimension 20</em> was the way they fully embraced the combat side of the game, by having every other episode be dedicated entirely to a combat encounter. Combat in RPGs tends to take a very long time, and my inclination had always been to try and skim over it as quickly as possible. <em>Dimension 20</em> takes the opposite view: if combat is going to take a long time, let’s accept that, and make it as fun and dramatic as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>I think embracing combat is a really good choice if you’re set on playing <em>D&amp;D</em>. So many of a character’s abilities are only relevant in combat that ignoring combat can mean ignoring many of the interesting decisions that a player makes as they level&nbsp;up.</p>
<h2><a id="Characters"></a>Characters</h2>
<p>We made the decision to start off with no one knowing anything about each other’s characters. The week before the first session, I spent an hour or two with each player, getting to know each character. This was so that I could build the story of the campaign around&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>(Yes, the idea of characters as somehow separate to the adventure; the idea of characters being able to slot into a pre-authored scenario with no modifications doesn’t make any sense to&nbsp;me.)</p>
<p>Here are the incredibly disorganised notes I took from those&nbsp;sessions:</p>
<h3>Bueller</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nobodyisthere.github.io/blog/images/bueller.jpg" alt="Notes on Bueller Santos"/>
    <figcaption>Bueller Santos</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Bueller’s player decided that since Bueller was a kenku, a species who can communicate only through reproducing sounds they’ve already heard, Bueller would communicate exclusively in memes and pop culture references, which fit really well with his nerdy personality. I took inspiration from Bueller’s name and decided that it’s a common kenku tradition to name your children after your favourite film. The full names of the Santos family&nbsp;were</p>
<ul>
<li>12 Angry Men Santos, <em>“12”, mother, proprietor of a jewellery&nbsp;store</em></li>
<li>Vertigo Santos, <em>father, airline&nbsp;pilot</em></li>
<li>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off Santos, <em>“Bueller”, high school&nbsp;student</em></li>
<li>Scarface Santos, <em>Bueller’s younger sister, middle school&nbsp;student</em></li>
<li>Bill Excellent Adventure Santos, <em>“Bill”, Scarface’s younger brother, middle school&nbsp;student</em></li>
<li>Ted’s Excellent Adventure Santos, <em>“Ted”, Bill’s twin brother, middle school&nbsp;student</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Amber</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nobodyisthere.github.io/blog/images/amber.jpg" alt="Amber Romero"/>
    <figcaption>Amber Romero</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Amber was a popular cheerleader in the year above most of the other characters. She didn’t have a great deal going on to drive her character. Her main concern was with being popular, so I tried to bring her into the story through her relationships with other&nbsp;characters.</p>
<p>She ended up being sort of a chosen one – the source of all magic. There were references to this throughout the campaign, but I was far too stingy with clues and failed to remind the players of key&nbsp;details.</p>
<h3>Sophie</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nobodyisthere.github.io/blog/images/sophie.jpg" alt="Sophie Shadwell"/>
    <figcaption>Sophie Shadwell</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sophie’s player was the only American in the group. That “14–18” in the top right corner is a note I took while asking her about her character. It’s the age range of American high school&nbsp;students.</p>
<p>I was a little out of my depth running this&nbsp;campaign.</p>
<p>Sophie’s player had a great idea for a scene right off the bat. It actually ended up being the first scene of the campaign. Preparing for the first session involved looking at the WikiHow article for “How to Put Down a&nbsp;Horse”.</p>
<h3>Hope</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nobodyisthere.github.io/blog/images/hope.jpg" alt="Hope Danvers"/>
    <figcaption>Hope Danvers</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Hope’s player wrote several pages of backstory, which were a joy to read. She created several characters that became major characters in the campaign, as Hope’s foster family were aware of and involved with the magical world. More on them&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>Thanks to this backstory, I was able to run a one-on-one side-adventure with her by text, covering the time that passed in a session she&nbsp;missed.</p>
<h3>Marlowe</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nobodyisthere.github.io/blog/images/marlowe.jpg" alt="Marlowe Faust"/>
    <figcaption>Marlowe Faust</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It’s interesting that these are the only notes I have on Marlowe. I spent the longest time out of everyone with Marlowe’s player, as he came in with only a vague idea of what he wanted to do. But I left with such a strong idea of Marlowe’s character that clearly I didn’t feel the need to write anything down. He was a theatre kid. Not a bard, but a warlock who had made a pact with The Bard. He was also a fairy, which is a custom race that’s almost identical to the&nbsp;half-elf.</p>
<p>(His name was originally going to be Faust Marlowe, but his player swapped the names before the first&nbsp;session.)</p>
<div class="rpg">
    <h4>Fairy Traits</h4>
    <p>Your fairy character has the following&nbsp;traits.</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Ability Score Increase.</span> Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by&nbsp;1.</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Size.</span> Your size is&nbsp;Medium.</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Speed.</span> Your base walking speed is 30&nbsp;feet.</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Darkvision.</span> You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern colour in darkness, only shades of&nbsp;grey.</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Fey Nature.</span> You are considered fey instead of&nbsp;humanoid.</p>
    <p>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can&rsquo;t put you to&nbsp;sleep.</p>
    <p>You only require 4 hours of sleep per&nbsp;day.</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Skill Versatility.</span> You gain proficiency in two skills of your&nbsp;choice.</p>
    <p><span class="trait">If Music Be The Food.</span> You do not need to eat or drink, though you may enjoy the pleasures of the material plane. Instead, you feed on the attention of&nbsp;others.</p>
    <p>Whenever you make a successful Charisma check that delights others or places you in the spotlight, you gain Inspiration if you did not have advantage on the&nbsp;check.</p>
    <p>Whenever you make an unsuccessful Charisma check, or embarrass yourself in public, the <span class="caps">DM</span>, at their option, may take Inspiration to use against you, or, if the failure was catastrophic enough, give you a level of&nbsp;Exhaustion.</p>
</div>

<p>There were other conditions, too – the usual fairy stuff: weakness to iron; inability to enter any place protected by a horseshoe;&nbsp;etc.</p>
<h3>Ferris</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nobodyisthere.github.io/blog/images/ferris.jpg" alt="Ferris Wheeler"/>
    <figcaption>Ferris Wheeler</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Ferris joined part-way through the campaign. I had him start at third level, like the other characters had. Hope gained an extra level during her side adventure. That meant that for a few sessions, the player characters spanned three&nbsp;levels.</p>
<p>It was absolutely fine; really not a big deal at&nbsp;all.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>28/3/2021</strong></p>
<h2><a id="Magic_items"></a>Starting items</h2>
<p>Each character started with at least one minor magic&nbsp;item.</p>
<h3>Amber</h3>
<figure class="right">
    <img src="https://nobodyisthere.github.io/blog/images/ah-amber-sprite.png" alt="Amber Romero"/>
</figure>

<div class="rpg">
    <h5>Baton of the Majorette</h5>
    <p class="rarity">Staff, uncommon (requires&nbsp;attunement)</p>
    <p>When you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell, you can use your reaction to turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. If the original spell targeted multiple creatures, the reversed spell only targets the caster. Other targeted creatures are still affected by the original spell. Once used, this property can&#8217;t be used again until the next&nbsp;dawn.</p>
</div>

<h3>Bueller</h3>
<figure class="right">
    <img src="https://nobodyisthere.github.io/blog/images/ah-bueller-sprite.png" alt="Bueller Santos"/>
</figure>

<div class="rpg">
    <h5>Hoodie of Hiding</h5>
    <p class="rarity">Hoodie,&nbsp;common</p>
    <p>While wearing this hoodie, you appear in your Human Form to all creatures that do not know your true form. This does not affect creatures that don&#8217;t rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight. While wearing the hoodie, you can use your action to lower the hood, revealing your true form to anyone&nbsp;watching.</p>
    <p>The hoodie also confers a +1 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in urban&nbsp;environments.</p>
    <h5>Uncle Jimmy&rsquo;s Nerf Rifle</h5>
    <p class="rarity">Weapon (Nerf rifle),&nbsp;common</p>
    <p class="rarity">(range 150/600; 1d8 piercing damage; ammunition; heavy;&nbsp;two-handed)</p>
    <p>This modified Nerf gun has a switch on the side that can be used to enable or disable its magical&nbsp;generator.</p>
    <p>When switched off, the gun fires regular foam bullets, dealing no&nbsp;damage.</p>
</div>

<h3>Ferris</h3>
<figure class="right">
    <img src="https://nobodyisthere.github.io/blog/images/ah-ferris-sprite.png" alt="Ferris Wheeler"/>
</figure>

<div class="rpg">
    <h5>Wrestling Band-aids</h5>
    <p class="rarity">Wondrous item, very&nbsp;rare</p>
    <p>A very rare, limited edition set of novelty band-aids depicting famous wrestlers. You can use your action to apply one to a creature within 5 feet of you, immediately activating its effect. There are six&nbsp;left:</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Meg Maniac.</span> The target gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage for one&nbsp;minute.</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Wayne &#8220;The Wall&#8221; Dobson and Donna Prima.</span> The target regains 3d6+6 hit&nbsp;points.</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Mama Sheen and John D. Greatest.</span> The target is immune to being frightened, and gains 5 temporary hit points at the start of each of its turns. This effect lasts for one minute, after which any remaining temporary hit points are&nbsp;lost.</p>
    <p><span class="trait">The Doc.</span> The target benefits from the effects of <em>remove curse</em>, <em>lesser restoration</em> and <em>spare the dying</em>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Hope</h3>
<figure class="right">
    <img src="https://nobodyisthere.github.io/blog/images/ah-hope-sprite.png" alt="Hope Danvers"/>
</figure>

<div class="rpg">
    <h5>St Christopher&rsquo;s medal</h5>
    <p class="rarity">Wondrous item, uncommon (requires&nbsp;attunement)</p>
    <p>While wearing this medallion, you appear in your Human Form as if under the effect of an <em>alter self</em>&nbsp;spell.</p>
    <p>This item also has the following feature if attuned to by Hope&nbsp;Danvers:</p>
    <p><span class="trait">I Will Fear No Evil.</span> When you are targeted by an effect that causes you to make a saving throw to prevent becoming frightened, you can use your reaction and touch this medallion. If you succeed on the saving throw, you gain temporary hit points equal to the amount by which you succeeded. Alternatively, you can touch a creature within 5 feet of you, and they gain those temporary hit points instead. You can use this ability once. It recharges at&nbsp;dawn.</p>
</div>

<h3>Marlowe</h3>
<figure class="right">
    <img src="https://nobodyisthere.github.io/blog/images/ah-marlowe-sprite.png" alt="Marlowe Faust"/>
</figure>

<p>Marlowe’s Book of Shadows was a battered script. It was the script of his life, writing itself as he lived. His clothes were imbued with fey magic, granting them the properties of light armour (<span class="caps">AC</span> 11 + <span class="caps">DEX</span>) and making them resistant to dirt and&nbsp;tears.</p>
<p>His weapon was an acoustic guitar that counted as a two-handed finesse weapon for him and did magical bludgeoning damage&nbsp;(d8).</p>
<h3>Sophie</h3>
<figure class="right">
    <img src="https://nobodyisthere.github.io/blog/images/ah-sophie-sprite.png" alt="Sophie Shadwell"/>
</figure>

<div class="rpg">
    <h5>Sophie&rsquo;s Druidic Focus</h5>
    <p>A locket containing some of Poppy&rsquo;s hair, and a&nbsp;poppy.</p>
    <p>Once per day, you can use this item to cast the <em>druidcraft</em>&nbsp;cantrip.</p>
    <p>This item also has the following feature if attuned to by Sophie&nbsp;Shadwell:</p>
    <p>While wearing this locket, you have advantage on Animal Handling, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception and Survival checks relating to&nbsp;horses.</p>
</div>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p>At one point, Sophie made buttons for all her friends. These had various effects that enhanced or augmented each character’s abilities. Most of them were existing traits from the 5th edition source books. Here are the&nbsp;details:</p>
<div class="rpg">
    <h5>Amber&rsquo;s button</h5>
    <p>Sophie Shadwell made this for you as a token of your friendship. While wearing it, you have the following&nbsp;ability:</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Pack Tactics.</span> You have advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of your friends is within 5 feet of the creature and the friend isn&#8217;t&nbsp;incapacitated.</p>
    <h5>Bueller&rsquo;s button</h5>
    <p>Sophie Shadwell made this for you as a token of your friendship. While wearing it, you have the following&nbsp;ability:</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Improved Primeval Awareness.</span> When you use your Primeval Awareness ability to detect your favoured enemies, you can also sense whether any of your party are present within 5 miles of you. You learn the general direction and distance (in miles) to those party members, as well as the identity of each party&nbsp;member.</p>
</div>

<p>Bueller never actually received his button. Instead, he got the following ability when his friend Will&nbsp;died:</p>
<div class="rpg">
    <h5>Angry Bird</h5>
    <p><span class="trait">Avenging Strike.</span> When you hit a creature that has reduced one of your friends to zero hit points, you can choose to deal maximum damage for the attack. The damage becomes magical, and ignores any resistances. Once you use this ability, you can&#8217;t use it again until you finish a long&nbsp;rest.</p>
    <h5>Ferris&rsquo; button</h5>
    <p>Sophie Shadwell made this for you as a token of your friendship. While wearing it, you have the following&nbsp;ability:</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Fighting Style: Protection.</span> When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack&nbsp;roll.</p>
    <h5>Hope&rsquo;s button</h5>
    <p>Sophie Shadwell made this for you as a token of your friendship. While wearing it, if you have revealed to the party that you are a tiefling, and Sophie has revealed to you that she is a half-elf, you have the following&nbsp;ability:</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Bond of Friendship.</span> When a creature you can see hits a friend who is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to halve the amount of damage they take. You take the remainder of the damage&nbsp;instead.</p>
    <h5>Marlowe&rsquo;s button</h5>
    <p>Sophie Shadwell made this for you as a token of your friendship. While wearing it, you have the following&nbsp;ability:</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Bardic Inspiration.</span> You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a&nbsp;d6.</p>
    <p>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the <span class="caps">DM</span> says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a&nbsp;time.</p>
    <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long&nbsp;rest.</p>
    <h5>Sophie&rsquo;s button</h5>
    <p>You made this for Bueller as a token of your friendship. He gave it back to you with a drawing of you on the&nbsp;back.</p>
    <p>While wearing this button, the number of times you can use your Wild Shape ability without taking a long rest is increased by&nbsp;one.</p>
</div>

<p>I let the players decide whether or not they would read out the details of their buttons, and they decided not to. I think this was a mistake, in hindsight. It’s fun for players to enjoy sharing the details of their loot, and it helps in combat if everyone has an idea about what everyone else can&nbsp;do.</p>
<h2>Other magic items</h2>
<p>And here are some other magic items I made for the&nbsp;campaign.</p>
<div class="rpg">
    <h5>Buff Gun</h5>
    <p class="rarity">Weapon (Nerf rifle),&nbsp;legendary</p>
    <p class="rarity">(range 150/600; 1d8 magical piercing damage; heavy;&nbsp;two-handed)</p>
    <p>A Nerf rifle styled to look like Ana&rsquo;s biotic rifle from <em>Overwatch</em>.</p>
    <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic&nbsp;weapon.</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Nano Boost.</span> When you hit a creature using this weapon, you can cast <em>haste</em> on them instead of dealing damage. The effect lasts for one minute or until the target loses concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Once used, this property can&apos;t be used again until the next&nbsp;dawn.</p>
    <h5>Fake <span class="caps">ID</span></h5>
    <p class="rarity">Wondrous item, very rare (requires&nbsp;attunement)</p>
    <p>A blank plastic photo <span class="caps">ID</span>&nbsp;card.</p>
    <p><span class="trait">One Man in his Life Plays Many Parts.</span> When you cast <em>disguise self</em>, you can magically change the appearance of this card as part of the spell. The card&apos;s new appearance must be a form of <span class="caps">ID</span>, and must be roughly the same size. Once you use this property, you can&#8217;t use it again until the next&nbsp;dawn.</p>
    <h5>Football</h5>
    <p class="rarity">Weapon (football),&nbsp;rare</p>
    <p class="rarity">(melee; thrown 30/60; 1d4 bludgeoning&nbsp;damage)</p>
    <p>This regulation size and weight football glows blue when orcs are near. So all the time,&nbsp;basically.</p>
    <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic&nbsp;weapon.</p>
    <h5>Hamwise the Brave</h5>
    <p class="rarity">Weapon (hammer),&nbsp;rare</p>
    <p class="rarity">(melee; 2d6 bludgeoning or piercing damage; martial; finesse;&nbsp;two-handed)</p>
    <p>This magic 6-foot hammer weighs only 4 lb, and has a telescopic handle that allows it to fold up to the size of a regular&nbsp;hammer.</p>
    <h5>Ki-chain</h5>
    <p class="rarity">Wondrous item,&nbsp;rare</p>
    <p>A cute keychain with a popular character on&nbsp;it.</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Digivolve.</span> You can use your action while holding this item to centre yourself. You regain one ki point and 1d8 temporary hit points. Once used, this property can&#8217;t be used again until the next&nbsp;dawn.</p>
    <h5>Lucky coin</h5>
    <p class="rarity">Wondrous item, very&nbsp;rare</p>
    <p>An old coin Sophie found her pocket after visiting the&nbsp;arcade.</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Lucky.</span> After rolling any die, but before the outcome is determined, you can use your reaction to reroll it. You choose which of the two rolls you use. Once used, this property can&#8217;t be used again until the next&nbsp;dawn.</p>
    <h5>Revolver of Truth</h5>
    <p class="rarity">Weapon (revolver), legendary (requires&nbsp;attunement)</p>
    <p class="rarity">(range 30/120; 1d8 force&nbsp;damage)</p>
    <p>This magic weapon contains six bullets of light called &#8220;truth bullets&#8221;. You can use an action on your turn to reload&nbsp;it.</p>
    <p>If you have the paladin&#8217;s Divine Smite ability, this weapon allows you to use that ability with ranged weapon&nbsp;attacks.</p>
    <p><span class="trait">Objection.</span> When a creature within 120 feet of you makes a statement that contradicts evidence you have, you can use your reaction to shoot that creature. The attack hits automatically, unless the creature is protected by a magical ward such as a <em>shield</em> spell, and the attack does psychic damage instead of force&nbsp;damage.</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="Plot"></a>Plot</h2>
<p>The initial idea I had for the story was that the party would eventually find out that they were all characters in the imagination (and possibly the <em>D&amp;D</em> game) of one of the NPCs. I’d have them find those character notes from <a href="ashville-high-part-1.html">part one</a> during the final&nbsp;encounter.</p>
<p>The dilemma would be this: the safest way to stop the villain is to deny them access to magic, by accepting that magic isn’t real, or something along those lines. But doing so means sacrificing important parts of your own&nbsp;existence.</p>
<p>This didn’t end up happening, because the players never encountered the <span class="caps">NPC</span> I’d set up as the source of magic. This was my fault for building too much of the story ahead of&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>What I should have done is what I did with the villain: wait until the story starts, then decide on the key plot points once you know what the players are interested in and what they want to engage with. I knew that I wanted the villain to be someone the players met in the first session, but I didn’t trust myself to set it up without giving it away, so I just played all the characters as best I could, then decided who it was after the fact, based on who the players decided to interact&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>So it wasn’t until the end of the first session that I knew who my villain was. Once that was in place, I could flesh out the rest of the villain’s scheme based on her actions in the first session and the kind of conclusion I had in&nbsp;mind.</p>

    <h2>Marlowe&rsquo;s Vision</h2>
    <p><em>The curtain rises on a figure in&nbsp;motley.</em></p>
    <p>Consider, ye who weep yet do not act,<br/>
        who act in life for love and on your stage<br/>
        do weep for those your tears will never reach<br/>
        Yet when the curtain falls and all is bare<br/>
        act not, weep not, hear not the desperate cries,<br/>
        Let ye who walk twixt truth and lies hear&nbsp;this:</p>
    <p><em>A school, with a dark shadow hanging over&nbsp;it.</em></p>
    <p>If in this world you hope to find<br/>
        the life and joy you left behind,<br/>
        and lift up high and ever more<br/>
        delight the souls and minds and for<br/>
        a day, a month, a thousand years<br/>
        assure your tithe of smiles and tears,<br/>
        Then hearken well, as well you must<br/>
        avert the fate that looms, and trust<br/>
        your soul to these, the symbols four,<br/>
        United face the threat in&nbsp;store.</p>
    <p><em>Enter four figures; the narrator joins&nbsp;them.</em></p>
    <p>First is scholar, mount and rider,<br/>
        hair of poppy close beside her.<br/>
        Second, seek the hooded crow,<br/>
        an actor too, though none may know.<br/>
        The third jewel shines, a gem from trees,<br/>
        with power she has yet to seize.<br/>
        The final part, with veiled face,<br/>
        a devil walks the path of&nbsp;grace.</p>
    <p><em>The curtain falls as iron bars, trapping you inside, looking out at the figures and the&nbsp;school.</em></p>

<p>I really wanted to use that trope where the lessons we see the characters having at school are relevant to the combat encounter or puzzle they’re going to come up against. This kind of fell by the wayside after the first encounter,&nbsp;though.</p>

    <figcaption>The first encounter of the campaign: the <span class="caps">IT</span> classroom.</figcaption>

<p>The first combat encounter was set in an <span class="caps">IT</span> classroom in which a magical computer virus caused the computers to come to life and attack people. I’ve always wanted to use modrons in an encounter ever since buying the <em>Monster Manual</em>, so this was my chance to do&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>I modified the modrons slightly so that two modrons could merge with each other to form a modron of the next level up. Every turn, the virus would spread from every infected computer or modron to all adjacent computers. The screen of an affected computer would glow green for one turn, after which it would transform into a&nbsp;modron.</p>

<h2><a id="Gizmo"></a>The Gizmo</h2>
<p><strong>If you play <em>D&amp;D</em> with me, please don’t read this&nbsp;section!</strong></p>
<p>The gizmo is a magic item that I gave one of the players in the third session. They had no idea what it did, so they never used&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Many of the effects are genre-specific, but most of them could be fun in any&nbsp;setting.</p>
<p>Several of the effects might seem disproportionately weak/powerful, or unbalanced. For example, the “Simon Says” effect has a relatively lacklustre prize, and no upper limit on how long the effect can continue. This is intentional, and reflects the personality of the character who made the&nbsp;gizmo.</p>
<div class="rpg">
    <h5>Gizmo</h5>
    <p class="rarity">Wondrous item,&nbsp;legendary</p>
    <p>The gizmo resembles a Rubik&#8217;s Cube made of copper and brass. Instead of coloured faces, each square has a small mechanical widget: a dial, gauge, lever, button, switch, etc. The gizmo is activated by manipulating one of these facets. Roll a d6 and a d10 and consult the tables below to determine the&nbsp;effect.</p>
    <p>When a 10 is rolled, the gizmo transforms into a gun turret that fires indiscriminately at the closest creature every turn. A gun turret has an <span class="caps">AC</span> of 10 and 10 hit points. When it drops to 0 hit points, it turns back into the&nbsp;gizmo.</p>
    <p>The gizmo can be thrown into a space immediately after a button is pressed but before the effect is&nbsp;determined.</p>
    <p>Some facets produce items. Those facets remain empty until the items they produced are&nbsp;destroyed.</p>
    <p>Some facets produce effects that require creatures to make saving throws. The <span class="caps">DC</span> for these saving throws is&nbsp;10.</p>
    <p>Some facets produce treats. Eating more than one of any type of treat, or eating more than three in one day may have a negative effect (e.g. the poisoned condition) at the <span class="caps">DM</span>&#8217;s discretion if a Constitution check is&nbsp;failed.</p>
    <p>Unless otherwise stated, the gizmo&#8217;s effects have a range of 30 feet and last for one minute. Unless otherwise stated, effects that transform the gizmo revert when the transformed gizmo drops to 0 hit points. Dropping to 0 hit points while transformed does not destroy the&nbsp;gizmo.</p>

A creature can lick the lollipop as a bonus action, expending one of its charges. That creature benefits from the effects of the <em>haste</em> spell until the start of their next turn. On subsequent turns, if the creature does not lick the lollipop, it suffers a sugar crash. Its speed is halved, it is poisoned, and it can&#8217;t take reactions. The sugar crash lasts for a number of turns equal to the number of times it licked the lollipop, or until the creature licks the lollipop again. Once the lollipop&#8217;s charges are spent, it becomes a regular lollipop stick.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">3</td><td><span class="trait">Chocolate.</span> The gizmo opens to reveal a heart-shaped chocolate. A creature who consumes the chocolate regards the next creature it sees as its true love for one hour.</td></tr>

            <tr><td></td><td class="c">7</td><td><span class="trait">Balloons.</span> A brightly-coloured button appears on the gizmo. Pressing the button causes the gizmo to inflate a helium balloon, which is attached to the gizmo with string. Up to 50 balloons can be created this way, enough to support the weight of a Large creature. The balloons slowly deflate over the course of 24 hours. The gizmo recharges at the same rate.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">8</td><td><span class="trait">Cleaner.</span> The face of the gizmo retracts, and the gizmo begins to suck up dirt and grime. This can be used in a similar manner to the <em>prestidigitation</em> cantrip.</td></tr>

            <tr><td class="c">4</td><td class="c">1</td><td><span class="trait">Time stop.</span> Time is frozen within 15 feet of the gizmo for 1d4 rounds. Creatures and objects within 30 feet of the gizmo have their speed halved for the duration.</td></tr>

            <tr><td></td><td class="c">3</td><td><span class="trait">Tracker.</span> The gizmo latches onto the closest creature or moving object, and drops a tracking device that can be used to locate it. A creature can spot the gizmo with a successful Investigation check. The <span class="caps">DC</span> for this check depends on the creature or object&#8217;s size class, and is 12 + 3 &times; the number of size classes larger than Medium.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">4</td><td><span class="trait">Rope trick.</span> The gizmo floats ten feet off the ground and produces a ten-foot rope. It then disappears into an extradimensional space, acting like a casting of the <em>rope trick</em> spell.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">5</td><td><span class="trait">Reverse gravity.</span> The gizmo reverses gravity in a 15-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder around it, for 1d4 rounds. The area acts as if under the effect of the <em>reverse gravity</em> spell.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">6</td><td><span class="trait">Grappling hook.</span> A 60-foot-length wire with a hook on the end shoots out from the gizmo. It attaches to the first surface it hits, and then retracts at a rate of 30 feet per turn.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">7</td><td><span class="trait">Alarm.</span> A dial appears on the gizmo, allowing a creature to set a time or a duration up to 24 hours. At that time, or after that duration, the gizmo rings like an alarm clock. The gizmo also rings if any creature that was not in range when the alarm was set comes within range.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">8</td><td><span class="trait">Parachute.</span> The gizmo sprouts straps and a parachute that prevent falling damage to a creature if it falls more than 60 feet through air. The straps and parachute detach when the creature lands.</td></tr>

            <tr><td></td><td class="c">10</td><td><span class="trait">Glue.</span> The targeted 5-foot square of ground becomes difficult terrain. A creature attempting to leave the space must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have its movement speed reduced to 0 for the turn.</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="c">5</td><td class="c">1</td><td><span class="trait">Rockin&#8217; horse.</span> The gizmo produces a wooden rocking horse in the nearest unoccupied space within range. The horse has an <span class="caps">AC</span> of 10 and 10 hit points. It is friendly to you and your allies, and rock music emanates from it. The horse grants a d6 bardic inspiration to a creature within range each turn. It remains for one minute or until it is destroyed.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">2</td><td><span class="trait">Action figure.</span> The gizmo transforms into a clockwork action figure or toy soldier. At the start of each of your turns, the figure commands you to perform a random action (Attack, Cast a Spell, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Hide, or Use an Object) for as long as it survives. Following its instructions does not cost you an action. It starts with 5 hit points and loses one at the end of each of your turns. It has an <span class="caps">AC</span> of 10.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">3</td><td><span class="trait">Dress-up doll.</span> The gizmo transforms into a miniature wardrobe, inside which is a doll and several outfits. A creature can spend one minute dressing up the doll, after which equivalent clothes appear on the creature and grant advantage on one ability check it makes in the next hour, depending on the outfit (so a sporty outfit would grant advantage on an Athletics check, for example.)</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">4</td><td><span class="trait">Doll&#8217;s house.</span> The gizmo transforms into a doll&#8217;s house. The house and everything within it is fully functional, just very small. Very tiny creatures and those shrunk by magic could live happily within. The house contains enough food to sustain such creatures for a week. In the children&#8217;s bedroom of the house is an even smaller doll&#8217;s house. Attempting to interact with it transforms the doll&#8217;s house back into the gizmo, ejecting its occupants into the nearest unoccupied spaces.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">5</td><td><span class="trait">Spinning top.</span> The gizmo transforms into a spinning top. When spun, it continues to spin for one round longer than any other spinning top within range, after which it transforms back. On its turn, it makes a melee attack against the closest spinning top within range, usually causing that top to stop spinning.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">6</td><td><span class="trait">Marbles.</span> About 50 marbles fall out of the gizmo, turning a 15-foot square area into difficult terrain. A creature that enters a marble-covered space must make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">7</td><td><span class="trait">Jack-in-the-box.</span> A crank handle protrudes from the gizmo. After the handle has been turned 1d8 times, a figure pops out.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">8</td><td><span class="trait">Duel Monsters.</span> A secret draw slides out from the gizmo, revealing the five pieces of Exodia.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">9</td><td><span class="trait">Music box.</span> The gizmo opens and plays music for 1 minute or until a creature uses an action to close it. When a creature moves into range or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep. Regardless of the result, it is then immune to this use of this effect, and wakes up when it takes damage, when another creature uses an action to rouse it, or when the music stops.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">10</td><td><span class="trait">Nerf turret.</span> The turret makes two attacks, has +2 to hit and deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage.</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="c">6</td><td class="c">1</td><td><span class="trait">Plot hook.</span> The gizmo opens to reveal any hook (for example, a fishing hook). The hook has an air of mystery, and is deeply related to whatever the <span class="caps">DM</span> wishes to set up next.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">2</td><td><span class="trait">Beholder&#8217;s eye.</span> The gizmo opens to reveal a beholder&#8217;s eyeball and part of the eyestalk from which it was taken. A creature can use the eyeball as an action. Roll a d10 to determine which type of eyestalk it was from (see the <em>Monster Manual</em> for the various effects). The <span class="caps">DC</span> for any saving throw is 10, and the maximum damage a ray can do is 2d8. Inside the eyeball is a diamond worth 300gp, which can be detected with a successful <span class="caps">DC</span> 20 Investigation check.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">3</td><td><span class="trait">Stealth light.</span> A secret drawer slides out from the gizmo. It appears to be empty, but in fact contains a glowing orb that emits bright light for 60 feet, and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The orb and the light it emits are only visible on the ethereal plane, and to those who have their eyes closed.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">4</td><td><span class="trait">Plot armour.</span> The gizmo opens to reveal a ring bearing a shield design. A main character who wears this ring and no other armour cannot be reduced to 0 hit points. Any attack that would reduce them to 0 hit points is miraculously avoided. The ring disintegrates after it has been worn for 24 hours.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">5</td><td><span class="trait">Wild magic.</span> The gizmo crackles and glows with magical potential. A wild magic surge occurs.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">6</td><td><span class="trait">Aura of the Protagonist.</span> The gizmo opens to reveal a glowing golden liquid. A creature who drinks the liquid has the Aura of the Protagonist for one hour. During this time, they have +1 bonus to their Charisma score and they cannot obscure their face with hair, a helmet, or similar. Their face is always well lit, even in dim light. Any non-hostile <span class="caps">NPC</span> they come into contact with must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or tell them their current problems. If they have no quests to offer, they must instead explain the history of the area, or provide other relevant exposition.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">7</td><td><span class="trait">Compass.</span> A gauge on the gizmo contains an arrow that points north, or in a direction of the <span class="caps">DM</span>&#8217;s choice.</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td><td class="c">8</td><td><span class="trait">Well of inspiration.</span> The gizmo transforms into a miniature well that produces an effervescent pink liquid.

    <h5>Cane of Candy</h5>

    <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals acid damage instead of piercing damage. The cane has 10 hit points, resistance to all damage, and is&nbsp;edible.</p>
    <p>Whenever you would take damage, the cane takes half of that damage instead of&nbsp;you.</p>
    <p>As an action, you can eat part of the cane to regain 1d6 hit points, reducing the cane&#8217;s hit points by&nbsp;1.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://nobodyisthere.github.io/blog/images/ah-03.jpg" alt="At Cordelia's Hallowe'en party, a fight breaks out between werewolves and vampires."/>
    <figcaption>The third encounter: the party gets caught up in a fight between werewolves and vampires.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The idea behind the third fight was that the party would get caught up in an important situation and would need to think quickly and get as much information as they could to prevent something bad from happening. In this case, the vampires had an objective to complete (obtain Cordelia’s necklace), the werewolves wanted to stop them, and the player characters would hopefully get involved because they knew Cordelia and would want to prevent whatever the vampires were intending to do with&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this didn’t really work out. The encounter was split across two floors, with Cordelia and the vampire leader upstairs, and the rest of the vampires defending the staircase from the werewolves. I wasn’t clear enough about where the important stuff was happening, and the fact that I hid most of the map with fog of war didn’t help. For the first few rounds of combat, the players didn’t seem to have any interest in going upstairs. They mostly just attacked the vampires and the werewolves indiscriminately. In the end, I had Will go upstairs and get killed by a vampire to draw their attention, which felt clumsy and&nbsp;mean.</p>
<p>If I were to run this encounter again, I’d give them more information upfront about the situation, and I wouldn’t plunge the house into darkness at the start of&nbsp;combat.</p>

<p>This isn’t something I prepared for the campaign, but Marlowe’s player said that what he was doing at the party was playing the guitar, trying to explain <em>Verfremdungseffekt</em> to the tune of “Wonderwall”.

<p>The next one <em>is</em> one I had anticipated singing in the campaign, but when it came down to it, I didn’t have the confidence to sing more than a couple of lines.

    <figcaption>The fourth encounter: the abandoned fairground arcade.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I ended up with less time to draw the map for this encounter, but I’m quite pleased with how it went. The main threat was the vampire called Niall Swordkiller, who was after Amber. He wanted to drink her blood and make her his thrall, giving him control over the source of all&nbsp;magic.</p>
<p>His partner in this fight was a magician, who was invisible for most of the&nbsp;fight.</p>
<p>The main gimmick of the fight worked well, though. In the centre was a “test your strength” attraction, with an image of a strongman behind it. At the start of the fight, thanks to the magician’s magic, the various attractions lit up and were rendered in colour, and the strongman came to life to fight the&nbsp;party.</p>
<p>The party could disable the strongman by “beating” the six attractions: the hook-a-duck, the hall of mirrors, the shooting gallery, the fortune teller, the coin pusher and the “test your strength” attraction. Each one contained a reward (one of the <a href="#Magic_items">magic items</a> listed above) and weakened the&nbsp;strongman.</p>
<p>It worked well overall. The minigames were simple and were resolved in one or two skill checks, but this was intentional, as I didn’t want the fight to drag on for too long (the previous two encounters had taken far longer than I had&nbsp;hoped).</p>

    <figcaption>The final encounter.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The final encounter took place in the school theatre. The party’s goal was to rescue Amber, who had been trapped in a fake world inside a crystal by Titania, Marlowe’s&nbsp;sister.</p>
<p>The set could change: as a lair action, Titania could rotate the set and bring the shop and the house together to form the barricade from <em>Les Misérables</em>.</p>
<p>This was the only encounter in which I had to reduce the difficulty on the fly. Most of the players seemed very reluctant to expend resources to try and leave the auditorium, despite the fact that it was dealing them significant damage every turn. I think I may not have been clear enough when describing the situation and their&nbsp;options.</p>
<p>Even with my on-the-fly adjustments (making Audrey <span class="caps">II</span> and Titania act a little less optimally), the fight was very close, with Marlowe and Will both dying, and nearly everyone dropping to zero hit points at one point or&nbsp;another.</p>

        <p><span class="trait">All Eyes On Me.</span> Titania regains 20 hit points at the start of her turn if she is on stage, has at least 1 hit point, and there are no creatures downstage of&nbsp;her.</p>
        <p><span class="trait">Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</span> If Titania fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed&nbsp;instead.</p>
        <p><span class="trait">Spellcasting.</span> Titania is a 9th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save <span class="caps">DC</span> 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). Titania has the following spells&nbsp;prepared:</p>

        <p><span class="trait">Multiattack.</span> Titania makes two claw&nbsp;attacks.</p>
        <p><span class="trait">Claw.</span> <em>Melee Weapon Attack.</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing&nbsp;damage.</p>
        <p><span class="trait">Source of All Magic (recharge 5&ndash;6).</span> While Amber remains trapped in the crystal, Titania can use her action to regain two spell slots of any&nbsp;level.</p>
        <h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
        <p>Titania can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature&#8217;s turn. Titania regains spent legendary actions at the start of her&nbsp;turn.</p>

        <p><span class="trait">Claw.</span> Titania makes one claw&nbsp;attack.</p>
        <h3>Lair Actions</h3>
        <p>Titania can use one of the following actions on initiative count 20 (losing ties). She can&#8217;t repeat an action until they have all been used, and she can&#8217;t use the same action two rounds in a&nbsp;row.</p>
        <p><span class="trait">Willkommen.</span> The auditorium becomes a cabaret until Titania loses concentration (as if concentrating on a spell).<br/>
The cabaret is difficult terrain.

A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the patrons takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.<br/>
A creature restrained by the patrons can use its action to make a <span class="caps">DC</span> 15 Strength or Dexterity check (its choice). On a success, it frees&nbsp;itself.</p>
        <p><span class="trait">Scene.</span> The set changes between the town and the barricade. Creatures are pushed downstage by the set if&nbsp;necessary.</p>
        <p><span class="trait">Could it be? Yes, it could.</span> The second time this action is used, Audrey <span class="caps">II</span>&nbsp;appears.</p>
