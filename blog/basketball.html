    <p><strong>A note from the&nbsp;future:</strong></p>
<p><em>Last year, I ran a D&amp;D campaign set in and around a modern-day <span class="caps">US</span> high school. Iâ€™m about to dump a load of assets and thoughts from that campaign onto this blog, but for now, enjoy these rules from the iconic fourth-session basketball&nbsp;encounter.</em></p>

<div class="rpg">
    <h2>Rules for&nbsp;Basketball</h3>
    <h3>Possession</h3>
    <p>A creature with two free hands can gain possession of the ball. When you gain possession, anyone on your team can use their reaction to gain an action and take part of their turn immediately. Alternatively, if you gained possession by using a reaction, you can gain an action as part of that same&nbsp;reaction.</p>
    <h3>New&nbsp;Actions</h3>
    <p>The following new actions are available to basketball&nbsp;players.</p>
    <h4>Follow&nbsp;(reaction)</h4>
    <p>When an opponent moves out of your reach, you can use your reaction to spend any remaining movement you have to follow them, instead of making an opportunity attack. This movement occurs after they have&nbsp;moved.</p>
    <h4>Intercept&nbsp;(reaction)</h4>
    <p>If the ball passes through your space, you can use your reaction to try and intercept it. Make a <span class="caps">DC</span> 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If you succeed, you gain&nbsp;possession.</p>
    <h4>Pass</h4>
    <p>Pass the ball to another creature. If you are marked, make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by their Dexterity (Sleight of Hand), or foul. If you lose, they gain&nbsp;possession.</p>
    <p>If the receiver is marked, they make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by their marker&#8217;s Strength (Athletics), or foul. If they lose, their marker gains&nbsp;possession.</p>
    <p>A creature is marked if they are within an opponent&#8217;s reach and the ball must pass through that opponent&#8217;s space or a space orthogonally adjacent to it to reach&nbsp;them.</p>
    <h4>Shoot</h4>
    <p>Attempt to score by throwing the ball into the basket. Make a Strength (Athletics) check. The <span class="caps">DC</span> depends on where you are when you make the&nbsp;shot.</p>
    <h6>Shooting&nbsp;DCs</h6>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th class="c"><span class="caps">DC</span></th>
                <th>Position</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td class="c">15</td>
                <td>The two spaces adjacent to the basket</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="c">10</td>
                <td>The six spaces adjacent to the spaces above</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="c">15</td>
                <td>Any other space within the 2-point zone</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="c">20</td>
                <td>Spaces just behind the 3-point line</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>For a shot from any other space, the <span class="caps">DC</span> is equal to the distance in feet to either of the spaces adjacent to the&nbsp;basket.</p>
    <p>A creature marking you can contest your check with their own Strength (Athletics) check, or foul. If they succeed, they gain&nbsp;possession.</p>
    <h4>Steal (action or&nbsp;reaction)</h4>
    <p>Attempt to take possession of the ball from an opponent within 5 feet. Make a contested Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, or foul. If the opponent has used the Dodge action, you make your check with&nbsp;disadvantage.</p>
    <p>This can be used as a reaction instead of an opportunity&nbsp;attack.</p>
    <h3>Fouls</h3>
    <p>Rather than making a contested check, you can instead foul, making a melee attack against your opponent. If you hit, you succeed on the check as well as dealing damage. Any other damage you deal during the game is also a&nbsp;foul.</p>
    <p>When you deal damage to an opponent, make a <span class="caps">DC</span> 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If you fail, the referee takes the side of your opponent and will punish your team with a turnover, or free throws for the fouled&nbsp;player.</p>
