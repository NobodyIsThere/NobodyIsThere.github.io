<p>If you were to steal my smartphone and open my photo library, you’d see something fairly unusual: hundreds and hundreds of screenshots from videogames. My trip to <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Lestallum">Lestallum</a> next to my trip to the Lake District. “Selfies” of my <em>Final Fantasy <span class="caps">XIV</span></em> character alongside photos of the North York Moors. My in-game photos are all mixed together with my regular photos, as if there were no real distinction between the two. But is&nbsp;there?</p>

<p>It all started with <em>A Hat in Time</em>. Or was it <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>? Or <em>Beyond Good <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Evil</em>? Actually, maybe it started with <em>Half-Life 2: Episode Two</em>, in which I began to document my journey with the <a href="https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Garden_Gnome">gnome</a> (unfortunately, those photos, and that game save, were then lost to a Windows reinstall). I’d love to know what the first screenshot I ever took in a game&nbsp;was.</p>
<p>But my current practice of storing my in-game photos in the same place as my regular photos? That started when I visited a friend, and we played <em>A Hat in Time</em>.</p>

<p>As soon as we got the camera badge that enables the in-game selfie mode, I started taking pictures. It’s a lovely game, and it was sometimes hard to resist getting the camera out for every achievement or pretty view. We had a great time, and when we stopped, I realised that I wanted to keep the photos we’d&nbsp;taken.</p>
<p>When I got home, I downloaded the photos from his Steam profile. I already had a folder for game screenshots, but while I was filing the new additions, it occurred to me that I hadn’t actually looked at any of the other photos in there for&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>Looking at those old screenshots was just like flipping through an old photo album. So then I thought about how much time I spend, and have spent, playing games with my friends, having fun together and exploring new worlds. And not only that: I have many happy memories of my time in single-player games as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>So why were my game screenshots consigned to a little-used folder on my hard&nbsp;drive?</p>

<p>The experiences we have within games are no less real than the experiences we have without. To qualify that before anyone gets any ideas: I am not saying that the experience of doing something in a game is <em>the same</em> as the experience of doing that thing in reality. What I’m saying is that any experience you have in a game, whatever that experience is, <em>is a real experience</em>.</p>
<p>If you are blown away by a breathtaking view, or go on a tough journey with a friend, you might want to take some photos to remember it. Just because it happened in a game, your experience isn’t worth any&nbsp;less.</p>

<p>Or maybe it is. At the end of the day, you are the only person who can decide how much each memory is worth to you. Perhaps you do value out-of-game experiences that much more than in-game ones. But I bet I’m not the only one whose photo library is full of screenshots. And even if I am, I’ll be surprised if, in a couple of decades’ time, I’m still the strange&nbsp;one.</p>
