    <p><strong>A note from the&nbsp;future:</strong></p>
<p><em>This is a warlock subclass that I came up with for someone else’s <em>D&amp;D</em> 5e game. It should be taken as a rough draft, as it has seen next to no playtesting, and was created to work for just one character in one&nbsp;campaign.</em></p>
<p><em>I really like the idea of a subclass based around bartering with knowledge. I wanted to evoke that sense of risk that you see in tales of devil-summoning. You know, the whole “be careful what you say;” “don’t tell it your true name” sort of thing. Perhaps I’ll revisit this subclass if I ever play a warlock&nbsp;again.</em></p>
<hr>
<div class="rpg">
    <h2>The Truthseeker</h2>
    <p>You have made a pact with a devil who thirsts for knowledge above all else. Although it is undoubtedly evil, it is not interested in destruction, for that would render its accumulated knowledge meaningless. Knowledge is power, and as the Truthseeker&#8217;s knowledge grows, it plots and schemes in the dark, preparing for the day when all things will be under its&nbsp;control.</p>
    <h3>Expanded Spell List</h3>
    <p>The Truthseeker lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for&nbsp;you.</p>
    <h6>Truthseeker Expanded Spells</h6>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th class="c">Spell Level</th>
                <th>Spells</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td class="c">1st</td>
                <td><em>command</em>, <em>identify</em></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="c">2nd</td>
                <td><em>locate object</em>, <em>zone of truth</em></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="c">3rd</td>
                <td><em>clairvoyance</em>, <em>glyph of warding</em></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="c">4th</td>
                <td><em>arcane eye</em>, <em>locate creature</em></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="c">5th</td>
                <td><em>geas</em>, <em>legend lore</em></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <h3>Truth for Truth</h3>
    <p>Starting at 1st level, you are able to use your patron&#8217;s infernal power to barter with knowledge. Activate this ability by touching a willing creature who has expressed its intention to tell the truth. While this ability is active, whenever you answer one of their questions truthfully, store one &#8220;truth point&#8221; against the creature. The effect ends if you tell a lie or if you end your turn in a position where neither of you are able to communicate with the other. Once you use this feature, you can&#8217;t use it again until you finish a short or long&nbsp;rest.</p>
    <p>You can store a total number of truth points equal to your warlock level. If you have any truth points stored against a creature, you may use a bonus action on your turn to ask it a question in return. If it chooses to answer, you know whether or not it is telling the truth. If it does not answer, you have advantage on your next attack roll, ability check or saving throw against it, and it has disadvantage on its next attack roll, ability check or saving throw against&nbsp;you.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <h6>Telling the Truth</h6>
        <p>The Truth for Truth feature requires you to answer questions &#8220;truthfully&#8221; in order to gain truth points. Here, &#8220;truthfully&#8221; means fully and honestly. Evasive but technically truthful answers will not grant you truth points (though they won&#8217;t end the effect,&nbsp;either).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Truthseeker&#8217;s Knowledge</h3>
    <p>Starting at 6th level, you can use your stored questions to find out more about a creature. This takes the form of a ritual with a casting time of 1 minute, and requires divining components worth at least 25gp. For each question you have stored against a creature, you can ask one question about it, or about something that it knows. The <span class="caps">DM</span> chooses from the following possible&nbsp;responses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Positive</em>, if the answer to your question is &#8216;yes&#8217; or&nbsp;similar</li>
        <li><em>Negative</em>, if the answer to your question is &#8216;no&#8217; or&nbsp;similar</li>
        <li><em>Positive and negative</em>, if the answer to your question is both positive and negative, or the creature has mixed or conflicting feelings about the&nbsp;answer</li>
        <li><em>Unknown</em>, if the question does not apply to the creature, or the creature does not know the answer to the&nbsp;question.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instead of asking a question about a creature, you can instead use this feature and all stored truth points (if any) to cast the <em>augury</em>&nbsp;spell.</p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can&#8217;t use it again until you finish a long&nbsp;rest.</p>
    <h3>Eyes of Truth</h3>
    <p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your Truthseeker&#8217;s Knowledge feature and all stored truth points (if any) to cast the <em>divination</em>&nbsp;spell.</p>
    <h3>Blind Bargain</h3>
    <p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your Truth for Truth feature on a creature you can see, without its knowledge or consent. This is similar to casting a spell with verbal and somatic components, and fails if you are unable to speak or move. A creature can notice your gestures or whispering with a successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your warlock spell save <span class="caps">DC</span>.</p>
